# template-filler
A short Python script which allows the user to change the value of pre-set variables inside a custom plain text template file.

## Getting Started

These instructions will walk you through everything which is required to get the script running on your computer

### Prerequisites

This what you will need to install in order to run the script

```
Python 3.7
pip Python Package Installer
Jinja 2.10.1
```

### Installing

Once you have obtained a copy of the script by either SSH or HTTPS you will need to ensure that both Python 3 & pip are installed on your computer.

This can be done by running the following commands:

```
python3
```

```
pip3 -V
```

If either of these failed you will need to go back and ensure that they are both installed, otherwise you can proceed to install the required plugins by using the following command:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Once all the required plugins have been installed you can then run the script for the first time. The script has to be ran from within the `program` directory.

```
cd program
```
```
python3 main.py
```
